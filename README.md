This repository contains the code about the course *Network dynamics and learning* 2021/2022 class of Politecnico of Turin.
In this project, the interplay between network dynamics, epidemics, game theory, and flow in complex systems have been explored. The project will use a combination of theoretical analysis, simulation, and data analysis to understand how these different factors interact with each other and shape the behavior of complex systems.




## Homework 1

In this project, we aim to investigate the dynamics of flow and capacity in a graph network. Specifically, we will analyze how the flow of resources or information through a network is affected by the capacities of the edges or nodes, and how changes in these capacities can impact the overall behavior of the network.

One of the key components of the project will be to develop algorithms and models for analyzing network dynamics, and for predicting how the flow of resources or information through a network will change under different conditions. We will also explore how to optimize flow and capacity in a network, with the goal of improving overall performance and efficiency.

In addition, we will investigate the impact of different types of networks, such as scale-free or random networks, on flow and capacity. By analyzing the structural properties of these networks, we can gain insights into how they affect the dynamics of flow and capacity, and identify potential areas for improvement.

Another important focus of the project will be to explore applications of network flow and capacity in various domains, such as transportation, communication, or logistics. By analyzing real-world systems and datasets, we can gain a deeper understanding of the challenges and opportunities associated with flow and capacity in networks, and identify potential solutions or innovations.

Overall, this project aims to provide a comprehensive and integrated view of network dynamics, flow, and capacity, and to explore the potential applications of these concepts in various domains. By combining insights from graph theory, optimization, and data analysis, we hope to develop new tools and techniques for understanding and optimizing complex network systems.
